    "description": "Quantum God is a clicker game where the game concept is based on the universe expansion theory. The main mechanic is to increase the size of your universe. In this game you will buy various physical objects and thereby increase your income. Also, you can upgrade your buildings by resetting their number to one. When you will gather enough size, you will be able to gain prestige points named &quot;U-Coins&quot;. There are also several achievements in the game, and you will receive various rewards for completing them. You will go from the size of neutrinos to the size of humans, stars, galaxies, and even much larger objects!",
